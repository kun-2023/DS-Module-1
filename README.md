<h3>Welcome to My World Population data analytics project.</h3>
<p>In this project, I got my data from <a href="https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/">a website</a> regarding to world populations regarding to most of th countries in the world. And I will explored the followings: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Countries with the most and the least populations</li>
  <li>The relationships between populations and other features such as land areas.</li>
  <li>The percentage of thw world's total population of top 10 countries.</li>
  <li>Last but not least, you will see an interactive graph allowing you to see top/bottom 10 countries under the metrics of your choice </li>
</ol>
<p>Pandas data manipulation tools, seaborn, and plotly dash skills are applied for this project.</p>
<foot>Enjoy!</foot>
